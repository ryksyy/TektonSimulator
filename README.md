# TektonSimulator

It is a work in progress.

### `Info`

GUI where users can choose their own gear or input their equipment stats to find out the 1 anvil rate

I have made a similar console application but the way it calculates is highly inefficient and changing gear values is only possible through changing the values in code

I do not play the game anymore and I am doing this as a practice project
